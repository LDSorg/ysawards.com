ysawards.com
============

A searchable list of all of the YSA wards around the globe.

**Problem**: If I search for the YSA ward I should attend using my dad's home address, it won't show any YSA wards because they're outside of the search radius for that address. Yet I still drive 40 minutes to get there, so it's still valid.

**Solution**: List all the YSA wards, let me search by state and city and I'll know which one is nearest me. The time information on LDS.org is usually incorrect, but the phone number for the bishop will usually reach his wife and from there I can figure out where I should be going.
